    <h1>CAT PHOTO APP</h1>
    <P>Cats are domestic animals that live around us, just like few other domestic animals,they can be kept as pets.
        There are different species of cats and each cat have their distinctive colors. Some cats have just a single
        color, examples are; plain black,
        white, grey or brown in color etc, while other cats are multicolored, examples are cats that are white with a
        touch of black, or grey cats with touches of black
        and brown, or orange cats with touches of white etc. There are male cats and female cats, the male cats are
        mostly single colored while the female cats are mostly
        multicolored. Cats feed on milk, fish, meat, eggs, chicken etc, there are also packaged food for cats made to
        provide them with the necessary vitamins and minerals
        needed for their growth. Cats are very affectionate animals especially with their owners, they are also very
        playful, fearful, sociable and aggressive, they have
        physical features such as claws, furs,long tails, whiskers, large eyes, long ears etc. A baby cat is called a
        kitten, also, a female cat can give birth to up to
        three or more kittens at a go. Cats are like people, some are mean, some are nice, some are arrogant, some are
        clingy, some have attitudes and some don't. They
        are fickle and complex. Cats are peaceful and independent animals. Some people do have misconceptions about
        them, some people see them as evil or demonic creatures,
        some think they are possesed, while some people see them as innocent and cute creatures which is why they take
        them in as pets. Cats are the most misunderstood
        animals in the world but if you understand them, there's no way you would not love them and they have very long
        lifespan of about fifteen to twenty years.
